## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge was to build out this Huddle Landing Page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- PostCSS (Autoprefixer)
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using webpack for this challenge was clearly not necessary, I would even say that I made it more difficult for myself. I used this module grouper because I wanted to put my newly acquired knowledge into practice on a simple project.

This challenge was an opportunity to discover :

- Webpack

```js
module.exports = {
    entry: path.resolve('./src/index.js'),
    output: {
        filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',
        path: path.resolve('./dist'),
        clean: true
    },
};
```

- CSS Grid Layout

```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1.25fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, max-content);
}
```

- How to create a container properly with automatic margins

```css
:root {
    --container-padding: 20px;
    --container-width: calc(100% - var(--container-padding) * 2);
    --container-max-width: 1000px;
}

.container {
    width: var(--container-width);
    max-width: var(--container-max-width);
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
```

- Embed JavaScript templating

```html
<header>
    <%= require('./components/logo/logo.ejs')() %>
</header>

```
